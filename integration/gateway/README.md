# Gateway

This example of gRPC API gataway based on `nginx`
See <https://www.nginx.com/blog/deploying-nginx-plus-as-an-api-gateway-part-3-publishing-grpc-services/>

And two example services: network (in python) and storage (in go)

And two example clients that send gRPC request via `nginx` gRPC API gataway to network and storage services.
