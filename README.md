# OPI Project PoC

This repo hosts OPI proofs of concept.  These PoCs are used to demonstrate that
the OPI project can work for some set of use cases.

## High level requirements

A PoC should demonstrate some aspect or aspects of OPI, for example a networking
PoC could demonstrate some networking application using OPI APIs, provisioning,
and lifecycle management.

In most cases, the PoC should
* be implemented by some set of containers
* include tests
* run on a variety of hardware configurations including virtual and multiple
  vendors' devices
