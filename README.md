This repo hosts OPI proofs of concept.  These PoCs are used to demonstrate that
the OPI project can work for some set of use cases.  As a result, OPI CI is
built on top of these PoCs.

## High level requirements

A PoC should demonstrate some aspect or aspects of OPI, for example a networking
PoC could demonstrate some networking application using OPI APIs, provisioning,
and lifecycle management.

In most cases, the PoC should

* be implemented by some set of containers
* include tests
* run on a variety of hardware configurations including virtual and multiple
  vendors' devices

## I Want To Contribute

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  We are happy to have the
Community involved via submission of **Issues and Pull Requests** (with
substantive content  or even just fixes). We are hoping for the documents,
test framework, etc. to become a community process with active engagement.
PRs can be reviewed by any number of people, and a maintainer may accept.
